title: Amphibians' Habitats and Adaptations in Africa

# Introduction

>_"Amphibians are the environmental canaries in the coal mine, telling us when ecosystems are in trouble."_

Africa is rich in a diverse collection of creatures, especially when it relates to amphibians. **Amphibians** are **cold-blooded vertebrate** animals, meaning that they change their body temperature depending on their environment. This section discusses these creatures' environments and how they adapt to them.
### Habitats

Amphibians are located near wet areas such as rivers, moist forests, and swamps. These creatures operate on land and in the water, giving them a unique quality. Listed below are places in Africa where amphibians live:

- Namib Desert  
	- Location: South-east side of Africa.
- Aberdare Mountains of Kenya  
	- Location: South-east side of Africa.
### Adaptations

These creatures are able to adapt to their surroundings by using their unique abilities. For example, frogs use their swimming abilities to eat aquatic animals, and salamanders can sample the air to identify prey. Ultimately, they use their land and water mobility to catch their prey and adapt to their surroundings.
# Africa's Animals

Here are a few amphibians that are found in Africa discussed in detail:
- [Web-footed Gecko](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.dadd6749eec6393b8caaa3019208010f?rik=fG2XGIvh1nSxdQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.reptilefact.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f02%2fWeb-footed-Gecko-Pictures.jpg&ehk=IwpP2A5eCjFtVEXlkc9latCRkLDzAYu%2fTcQW7e%2bOM%2bE%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0&sres=1&sresct=1):
	- Length: 5".
	- Location: Lives in the Namib Desert.
	- Adaptation :
		- This creature adapts to its desert environment by using its unique abilities to catch its prey and escape from predators. During the night, when its prey is most active, this creature uses its night visions to detect movement. Once it identifies life in its prey, it uses its quick reflexes and jaws to capture its prey. When this creature is hunted, it uses its tail as a decoy when seized. As the predator is distracted with the detached tail, the gecko burrows underneath the ground to hide from the hunter. 
		- Food: This creature can eat flies, crickets, beetles, and spiders.
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- Its preferred body temperature is similar to humans.
- [Common Chameleon](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.uwMODkpGhQ6XxBprWuiljgHaE8?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain&o=7&rm=3)
	- Length: 9-12".
	- Weight: Unknown.
	- Location: Northern sections of Africa.
	- Adaptation
		- This creature slowly stalks its prey and using its two independently mobile eyes to evaluate the distance from its prey. After the calculation is complete, the chameleon shoots out a long tongue at its target to retrieve as its meal.
	- Food: Eats a variety of insects such as locusts and crickets.
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- Its tongue is capable of exceeding speeds of 16.5' per second.
## Summary

Amphibians are cold-blooded creatures that live in wet areas such as the Amazon Rainforest. These creatures can range from frogs to salamanders, which thrive in these special habitats. These creatures can also be food for [[africa-habitats-animals/africa-reptiles|reptiles.]]
