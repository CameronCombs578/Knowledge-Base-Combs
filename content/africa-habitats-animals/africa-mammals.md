# Introduction

>_"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."_
>â€” Mahatma Gandhi (often applied broadly, including mammals)

Mammals are warm-blooded animals that live in Africa. They are distinct from other animals because of their hair and fur. In this section, mammals' habitats and adaptations are explored.
### Habitats

These creatures, unlike others, are not as limited to their environments. They are able to live in forests, grasslands, tundra, wetlands, rainforests, and mountains. Since these creatures live in various environments, they use their diverse abilities to survive.
### Adaptations

Mammals that live in grasslands either eat vegetation, fruit from the trees, or other animals in the fields. In forests, mammals live either in the trees or by the trees. In swamps and tundra environments, mammals can eat and live underwater and on land. 
### Animal Example

Below are multiple mammals that live and adapt in the environments discussed above:

- [Desert Hedgehog](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.JpXzhqyWWSNzCLefNMkPTQHaEp?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain&o=7&rm=3):
	- Length:
		- Head/Body: 5-11"
		- Tail: 0.4-1.5".
	- Weight: up to1.5 lbs.
	- Location: This creature can be found in semi-desert boarders of Sahara in Africa and the Arabian Desert.
	- Adaptation:
		- It uses its great sense of smell and hearing to identify its prey. These abilities make up for its poor vision.
	- Food: It east a wide range of food including insects and spiders.
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- This creature can curl up only revealing its pointy spines to protect itself from danger.

## Summary

Mammals have a wide range of locations and abilities. They can live in nearly every environment and are warm-blooded creatures. Africa is rich in a diverse selection of mammals.
