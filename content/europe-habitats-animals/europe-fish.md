Fish are creatures that live underwater and in environments unlike animals on the surface. These creatures are cold-blooded, limbless, and breathe underwater. Many [[antarctica-birds|birds]] eat these kinds of creatures. This section covers fish habitats and adaptations in the Americas.
### Habitats

Fish can live in rivers, ponds, and oceans. Places such as the Amazon River are rich in diverse kinds of fish. Nearly every large portion of water contains some amount of fish.
### Adaptations

Fish are able to adapt to their environments by using their gills to extract oxygen from water and by moving to the surface to take in oxygen. Also, they use their fins to navigate through their environments. These abilities enable them to survive in underwater conditions.
### Animals Example
