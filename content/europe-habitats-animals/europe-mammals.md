# Introduction

>_"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."_
>â€” Mahatma Gandhi (often applied broadly, including mammals)

Mammals are warm-blooded animals that live in the Europe. They are distinct from other animals because of their hair and fur. In this section, mammals' habitats and adaptations are explored.
### Habitats

These creatures, unlike others, are not as limited to their environments. They are able to live in forests, grasslands, tundra, wetlands, rainforests, and mountains. Since these creatures live in various environments, they use their diverse abilities to survive.
### Adaptations

Mammals that live in grasslands either eat vegetation, fruit from the trees, or other animals in the fields. In forests, mammals live either in the trees or by the trees. In swamps and tundra environments, mammals can eat and live underwater and on land. 
### Animal Example

Here is an mammal that lives in Europe

	- Length:
		- Head/Body: 2.5-3.5".
		- Tail: 1.5-2.5".
	- Weight: 0.65-1.5 oz.
	- Location: The majority of southern and central Europe.
	- Adaptation:
		- When this creature hunts, It uses a special technique to get a meal. It uses its tail to capture its prey instead of its mouth. After some time, the mammal transfers its prey from its tail to its mouth.
	- Food: Insects and invertebrates.
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- Females huddle together in large groups during daylight
## Summary

Mammals have a wide range of locations and abilities. They can live in nearly every environment and are warm-blooded creatures. Europe is rich in a diverse selection of mammals.
