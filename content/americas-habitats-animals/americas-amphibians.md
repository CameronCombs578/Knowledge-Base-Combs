# Introduction

>_"Amphibians are the environmental canaries in the coal mine, telling us when ecosystems are in trouble."_

North America is rich in a diverse collection of creatures, especially when it relates to amphibians. **Amphibians** are **cold-blooded vertebrate** animals, meaning that they change their body temperature depending on their environment. This section discusses these creatures' environments and how they adapt to them.
### Habitats

Amphibians are located near wet areas such as rivers, moist forests, and swamps. These creatures operate on land and in the water, giving them a unique quality. Listed below are places in the Americas where amphibians live:

- Amazon Rainforest  
	- Location: State of Amazonas, South America.
- Deciduous forests  
	- Location: Eastern U.S.A.
### Adaptations

These creatures are able to adapt to their surroundings by using their unique abilities. Frogs use their swimming abilities to eat aquatic animals, and salamanders can sample the air to identify prey. Ultimately, they use their land and water mobility to catch their prey and adapt to their surroundings.
### Animals

Here are a few amphibians discussed above:
