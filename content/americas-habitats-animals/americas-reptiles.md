>"Reptiles are survivors; they carry with them the history of ancient worlds."

Animals with dry, scaly, or rough and bumpy skin normally indicate that the creature is a reptile. There is a large range of reptiles equipped with amazing abilities. The following section discusses the habitats and adaptations of reptiles.
### Habitats

Reptiles normally live in wet areas, deserts, and forests. These habitats allow some to camouflage in their surroundings, which enables them to more easily catch their prey that live in these regions, such as [[americas-amphibians|amphibians]]. 
### Adaptations

These creatures are able to thrive in such environments for many reasons. Dry, rough, and bumpy skin allows these creatures to live in environments where there is limited water. Their ability to lay eggs also provides food for the parents and other creatures. Certain reptiles are also equipped with sharp teeth, poison, or shells, which enable them to adapt to their environments.
