Fish are creatures that live underwater and in environments unlike animals on the surface. These creatures are cold-blooded, limbless, and breathe underwater. Many [[antarctica-birds|birds]] eat these kinds of creatures. This section covers fish habitats and adaptations in Antarctica.
### Habitats

Fish can live in rivers, ponds, and oceans. Places such as the Amazon River are rich in diverse kinds of fish. Nearly every large portion of water contains some amount of fish.
### Adaptations

Fish are able to adapt to their environments by using their gills to extract oxygen from water and by moving to the surface to take in oxygen. Also, they use their fins to navigate through their environments. These abilities enable them to survive in underwater conditions.
### Animals

Some fish that live in Antarctica include:  

- [Dogfish](https://www.seattleaquarium.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pacific-spiny-dogfish-featured.jpg):
	- Length: 32-64".
	- Weight: up to 20 lbs.
	- Location: Antarctic sea.
	- Adaptation:
		- Each egg from this creature is inside a 'mermaid's purse'. This 'purse' is secured to plants and as the unborn fish begins to make movement, oxygen is pumped into the 'purse.' Once the 'mermaid's purse' breaks, the fish has a yolk sac attached to its belly providing the creature's needs until it can hunt.
	- Food: This fish eats mollusks, crustaceans, and fish.
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- This creature is excellent in its sense of sight and smell.
## Summary

Fish in Antarctica are amazing creatures ranging in size and color. Fish can be found in practically every large body of water, making them great creatures to study.
