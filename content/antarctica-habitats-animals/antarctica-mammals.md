# Introduction

>_"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."_
>â€” Mahatma Gandhi (often applied broadly, including mammals)

Mammals are warm-blooded animals that live in Antarctica. They are distinct from other animals because of their hair and fur. In this section, mammals' habitats and adaptations are explored.
### Habitats

These creatures, unlike others, are not as limited to their environments. They are able to live in forests, grasslands, tundra, wetlands, rainforests, and mountains. Since these creatures live in various environments, they use their diverse abilities to survive.
### Adaptations

Mammals that live in grasslands either eat vegetation, fruit from the trees, or other animals in the fields. In forests, mammals live either in the trees or by the trees. In swamps and tundra environments, mammals can eat and live underwater and on land. 
### Animal Example

Below is an mammal that lives in Antarctica.

- [Orca](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.2BiUUe5vis7OyP2eOUXyNQHaEe?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain&o=7&rm=3):
	- Length:
		- Males: 29.7'.
		- Females: 26.4'.
	- Weight
		- Males: up to 16,940 lbs.
		- Females: up to 12,100 lbs.
	- Location: Found in every ocean.
	- Adaptation:
		- A group of these creatures communicate with each other by giving off whistles, tones, and screams. Also, these creatures change their hunting strategies based on their numbers. If there is only one orca, it will focus on smaller prey while groups go after larger prey.
	- Food: fish, seals, other whales, and [[antarctica-fish|fish.]]
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- Orcas will take the time to come to the surface to look at the sky.

## Summary

Mammals have a wide range of locations and abilities. They can live in nearly every environment and are warm-blooded creatures. Antarctica rich in a diverse selection of mammals.
