# Introduction

The Earth is known as the Blue Planet because of the amount of water that takes up the world. Even though the oceans take up about 71 percent of the world, very little information has been collect about there inhabitants and habitats. However, this section will discuss some of the information that has been collected from the oceans as they relate to animal habitats and adaptations.

## Zones

ocean contains multiple habitats. Listed below are a few of these environments.

1. Sunlight Zone:
	- Description: This section is 0-200 meter deep in the ocean. It receives large portions of light and heat, and this place home most of ocean life.
	- Habitats:
		- Coral Reefs.
		- Kelp Forests.

2. Twilight Zone:
	- Description: This section receives little sunlight and heat. Therefore, it is colder than the previous zone. Its depth is 200-1,00 meters.
	- Habitats:
		- Open Water.
		- Transition Zone: There are no structures like reefs and live changes because less amount of light and heat.
	
3. Midnight Zone:
	- Description: Depth is 1,000-4,000 and it receives no sunlight along with the next zones. Therefore, the temperature in this zone is low. Gian squid, gulper eels, and other creatures live here.
	- Habitats:
		- Open Deep Ocean.
		- Occasional Hydrothermal Vent Fields
	
4. Abyss:
	- Description: This section of the ocean experiences high pressure and very low temperatures.
	- Habitats:
		- Abyssal Plains: flat surfaces covered with mud and sediment.
		- Hydrothermal Vents
		- Cold seeps: Places where certain chemicals seep from the seabed.
	
5. Trenches:
	- Description: 6,000-11,000 deep in the ocean is where this zone is located. The temperature here is nearly freezing and creatures here live in crushing pressure levels. Only creatures that can adapt to these conditions can live here such as snailfish and microbial life.
	- Habitats
		- Ocean Trenches: The lowest part of the of the ocean.
		- Trench Floors and Walls: extreme pressuring environment.
## Adaptation

Each creature in these zones adapt to there environment in diverse ways. It is difficult to simply state how these creatures change with their surroundings. Below are links to other pages discussing how fish use their unique abilities to adapt to their own environments.
