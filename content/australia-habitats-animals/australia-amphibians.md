# Introduction

>_"Amphibians are the environmental canaries in the coal mine, telling us when ecosystems are in trouble."_

**Amphibians** are **cold-blooded vertebrate** animals, meaning that they change their body temperature depending on their environment. This section discusses these creatures' environments and how they adapt to them.
### Habitats

Amphibians are located near wet areas such as rivers, moist forests, and swamps. These creatures operate on land and in the water, giving them a unique quality. 
### Adaptations

These creatures are able to adapt to their surroundings by using their unique abilities. For example, frogs use their swimming abilities to eat aquatic animals, and salamanders can sample the air to identify prey. Ultimately, they use their land and water mobility to catch their prey and adapt to their surroundings.
### Animals

Here are a few amphibians that live in Australia:
- [Skinks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Blue-toungued_skink444.jpg):
	- Length: 
		- Head/Body: 3.5-14"
		- Tail: 11.75-9"
	- Weight: up to 2.5 oz.
	- Location: Widespread in Australia.
	- Adaptation:
		- These creatures are not rapid runners. Therefore, to adapt to their surroundings they feed off of slower animals.
	- Food: It easts fruits, insects, and snails.
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- Skinks share the ability to detach their tail as lizards do.
- [Frilled Lizard](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.xOceJJkkTbTA9RXA_GJyEgHaE8?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain&o=7&rm=3)
	- Size: 28-42".
	- Weight: up to 26 oz.
	- Location: Western parts of Australia.
	- Adaptation:
		- If a frilled lizard is threatened, it erects its frill and lashes out with their tail at the opposing animal. If this does not intimidate the opposing creature. than it runs away.
	- Food: Eats a insects such as butterflies and moths, larvae, and other creatures.
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- This animal uses its hindlegs to run after prey and away from predator.
## Summary

Amphibians are cold-blooded creatures that live in wet areas. These creatures can range from frogs to salamanders, which thrive in these special habitats. These creatures can also be food for [[antarctica-reptiles|reptiles.]]
