# Introduction

>_"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."_
>â€” Mahatma Gandhi (often applied broadly, including mammals)

Mammals are warm-blooded animals that live in Asia. They are distinct from other animals because of their hair and fur. In this section, mammals' habitats and adaptations are explored.
### Habitats

These creatures, unlike others, are not as limited to their environments. They are able to live in forests, grasslands, tundra, wetlands, rainforests, and mountains. Since these creatures live in various environments, they use their diverse abilities to survive.
### Adaptations

Mammals that live in grasslands either eat vegetation, fruit from the trees, or other animals in the fields. In forests, mammals live either in the trees or by the trees. In swamps and tundra environments, mammals can eat and live underwater and on land. 
### Animal Example
