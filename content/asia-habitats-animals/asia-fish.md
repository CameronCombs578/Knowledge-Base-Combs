Fish are creatures that live underwater and in environments unlike animals on the surface. These creatures are cold-blooded, limbless, and breathe underwater. Many [[antarctica-birds|birds]] eat these kinds of creatures. This section covers fish habitats and adaptations in Asia.
### Habitats

Fish can live in rivers, ponds, and oceans. Places such as the Amazon River are rich in diverse kinds of fish. Nearly every large portion of water contains some amount of fish.
### Adaptations

Fish are able to adapt to their environments by using their gills to extract oxygen from water and by moving to the surface to take in oxygen. Also, they use their fins to navigate through their environments. These abilities enable them to survive in underwater conditions.
### Animal Example

Here is a fish that lives in Asia

- [Perch](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.r6UVLRClfQjJsyap37k3oAHaD3?cb=12&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain&o=7&rm=3):

	- Weight: up to 10 lbs. Normally, it is 2.5 lbs.
	- Location: Across Northern Asia.
	- Adaptation:
		- This creature tends to live in a shoal because these places do not home other fish called pike. These fish are their predators and live in ponds do. therefore, The location that the perches have chosen helps their numbers not decrease.
	- Food: Eats animal plankton, insects, and small fish.
	- Amazing Fact: 
		- They lay their eggs in ribbons that stick to objects.
## Summary

Fish in Asia are amazing creatures ranging in size and color. Fish can be found in practically every large body of water, making them great creatures to study.
